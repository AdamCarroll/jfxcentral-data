    "type": "YOUTUBE",
    "description": "Follow Java Champion Hendrik Ebbers on his story of \"Little Duke's Journey to the Moon\". During this keynote presentation held at JFX Days 2020 on Nov 24, 2020, Hendrik investigates what is wrong with Java in regards of the development of desktop applications. Is this a problem of Java - although it is still one of the most used programming languages? Or is it a problem of Java Desktop respectively JavaFX? Or maybe the problem is the community or - even worse - Oracle itself. \n\nIn this entertaining talk, Hendrik points out that there is no problem with all of the above. Developers need to accept that Java Desktop is a niche. But all together, the community can make this niche shine.",

    "type": "YOUTUBE",
    "description": "Gluon has been the defacto JavaFX steward since the JavaFX 11 release. Gluon builds and maintains the JavaFX artifacts and makes them available as SDK's as well as on Maven Central. Moving JavaFX forward is often a balance between adding new features and staying at the front of the UI development, while also making sure that the core principles of Java, especially backward compatibility, are respected.\n\u200B\nIn the past year, focus was mainly on the transition to making JavaFX a set of modules that work well with evolving JDK releases as well as integrate with standard build, deploy and devops tools that are popular in the development community. One of the main focusses of JavaFX is to make sure it works on as much platforms as possible: desktop, but also mobile and embedded. In this session, Johan Vos, CEO of Gluon, presented some of the future ideas.",

    "title": "Building Modular JavaFX Applications with JPMS and Layrry | Andres Almiray @ JFX Days 2020\n",
    "type": "YOUTUBE",
    "description": "The Java Module System lays the foundation for building modularized applications on the JVM. It doesn't concern itself though with resolving module versions and obtaining modules from repositories. This is where Layrry comes in: an API and launcher for modularized Java applications which takes a descriptor of the module layer(s) to assemble, fetches the modules and starts up the application. Layrry also allows dynamic loading.unloading of plugins which makes it ideal for JavaFX applications, allowing app developers to provide behavior on the fly.\n\nPresented by Andres Almiray at JFX Days 2020.",

    "title": "JavaFX Game Development: Enter FXGL Engine | Almas Baimagambetov @ JFX Days 2020\n",
    "type": "YOUTUBE",
    "description": "Modern JavaFX provides hardware acceleration support on a range of platforms, including desktop, mobile and embedded, allowing the development of high-performance cross-platform applications. However, to develop games with JavaFX effectively, numerous domain-specific concepts are needed. \n\nTo address this need, the FXGL game engine extends JavaFX and brings support for real-world game development techniques. These include the entity-component model, A* pathfinding, particle systems, sprite sheet animations and many other features. As a result, JavaFX developers can produce games more quickly and more effectively with FXGL. \n\nIntegrating seamlessly with Gluon's Client plugin, FXGL users can easily package their games to native platform images, including Android and iOS. By the end of this session, attendees will be able to: \n\n- Describe and explain basic FXGL features. \n- Produce a simple game with FXGL.\n\nThis session of Almas Baimagambetov was recorded on Nov 24, 2020 during the JFX-Days 2020.",
