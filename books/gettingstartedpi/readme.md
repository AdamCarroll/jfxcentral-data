Get started with the latest versions of Java, JavaFX, Pi4J, Spring and so much more. Learn the power (and fun!) of experimenting 
with electronics. All explained in many small and easy to understand examples.

When I first managed to blink an LED connected to a Raspberry Pi with Java, I was super excited! Controlling physical things with 
some lines of code is magic! This book includes a lot of info and history about Java itself and how to install it on the Raspberry Pi. 
Also, a lot of tips and tricks to become or be a better developer. 

In this book you will find many simple examples on these and even more topics:

* The magic of Bits and Bytes and solving the confusion of Java signed values with the help of an LED number display.
* Beautiful user interfaces made with JavaFX, so you can interact with the hardware.
* Pi4J applications to be able to control different types of hardware like LEDs, buttons, displays, led strips, relay boards and more.
* Spring applications, so you can interact with your Pi via web interfaces.
* How to set up a queue, so you can send and receive messages to and from Arduino boards or other Pi's.
* A lot of other inspirational ideas and getting started examples, to be able to build your dream do-it-yourself project.
  
My goal was to collect all the information I which would have been bundled at the time I started my own experiments with Java on the Raspberry Pi.
If you are new to Java, you will learn the language bit by bit, by following the examples. As an experienced Java programmer, you will learn how 
you can extend your knowledge and control the world around you with simple and inexpensive components.
