Create media-rich client applications using JavaFX 9 and the Java 9 platform. Learn to create GUI-based 
applications for mobile devices, desktop PCs, and even the web. Incorporate media such as audio and video
into your applications. Interface with hardware devices such as Arduino and Leap Motion. Respond to 
gesture control through devices such as the Leap Motion Controller. Take advantage of the new HTTP2 API 
to make RESTful web requests and WebSockets calls.

New to this edition are examples of creating stylized text and loading custom fonts, guidance for working 
with Scene Builder to create visual layouts, and new content on developing iOS and Android applications 
using Gluon mobile. The book also covers advanced topics such as custom controls, JavaFX 3D, gesture devices, 
printing, and animation. Best of all, the book is full of working code that you can adapt and extend to all 
your future projects.

Is your goal to develop visually exciting applications in the Java language? Then this is the book you want at 
your side. JavaFX 9 by Example is chock-full of engaging, fun-to-work examples that bring you up to speed on the
major facets of JavaFX 9. You'll learn to create applications that look good, are fun to use, and that take advantage
of the medium to present data of all types in ways that engage the user and lead to increased productivity.
