CuratorOR Caliop, developed by EIZO GmbH in Germany, is an application that will be installed in 
hospitalsâ€™ operating rooms. It is being installed in wall-mounted consoles equipped with a Windows PC 
running Java 8. The consoles also include additional hardware for routing video input signals to 
various monitors / displays and hardware for recording video signals (video and screenshots). The 
operating room personnel uses Caliop to look up patient data, to document the surgery, and to store 
the produced documents in the central hospital database.

One of the more interesting aspects of this project was the fact that JavaFX was able to take a 
very detailed and sophisticated HTML mock-up and implement it 1 to 1. We were also very happy about 
the built-in media player which allowed us to show the recorded videos directly inside the JavaFX UI 
with only a few lines of code. We were able to fulfill all customer requirements with JavaFX.
