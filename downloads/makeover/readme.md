This is an interactive presentation software presented by Dirk Lemmermann and Hendrik Ebbers at various conferences 
(JFXDays, JavaOne, etc...). The application takes the user step by step through the process of beautifying a given and
pretty boring movie archive software. Individual steps can be activated and taken back at any time and in any sequence. 
Slides with background information are also embedded directly into the application.

The code [can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/hendrikebbers/ExtremeGuiMakeover)
