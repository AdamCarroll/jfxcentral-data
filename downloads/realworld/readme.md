The "Real World Apps" presentation is a talk that has been given by Dirk Lemmermann and Alexander Casall at various
conferences in Europe and the United States. It contains an impressive list of JavaFX applications developed for various domains
such as manufacturing execution systems, operating rooms, medical research, sports, music, call centers, customer 
relationship management software, etc...

You can also find all of these applications shown in this presentation here on JFX-Central but we figured you might need 
to show some of this stuff to your "decision makers" in your next meeting with him or her.
