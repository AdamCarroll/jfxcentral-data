Scenic View is a JavaFX application designed to make it simple to understand the current 
state of your application scene graph, and to also easily manipulate properties of the 
scene graph without having to keep editing your code. This lets you find bugs, and get 
things pixel perfect without having to do the compile-check-compile dance.
