JavaFX is the standard tool for GUI development (replacing Swing in Java SE), and the next step 
in the evolution of Java. Learn how to use JavaFX to develop your own interfaces for enterprise 
apps in these lessons from Peggy Fisher, our in-house programming expert. She explains how JavaFX 
connects to other Java APIs, how to use FXML to separate the UI design from the application logic, 
and how to draw lines and shapes with the 2D class objects. To make your GUIs more interactive, 
she shows how to apply effects and add images, charts, and animation to your JavaFX projects. 
Finally, learn how to integrate CSS to customize your JavaFX interface designs. Challenges issued 
along the way allow you to test your new JavaFX skills as you build them.
