The JavaFX Documentation Project is designed to collect important JavaFX information from around 
the web and, with the permission of the authors, to collate it into a single source to form a 
cohesive book.

This project was initiated by Jonathan Giles, but anyone can contribute. Any questions, concerns, 
or feedback should be in the first instance be directed to [Jonathan via email](mailto:jonathan@jonathangiles.net).
