It mainly provides a CSS stylesheet that closely resembles the original while being custom tailored for JavaFX's unique CSS flavor.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that Twitter Bootstrap delivers more than just a standardized look for common widgets. It also provides new widgets, behavior and a grid system. Some of these features may be ported at a later stage to BootstrapFX.",

A lot of work went into the API to make it as intuitive to use by developers as the UI is by the users.
