The default development branch is `jfx-13`. Both `master` (JavaFX 8) and `9.0.0` (JavaFX 9+) branches exist for critical bug fixes only.

If you **want to play** with the ControlsFX sample application, clone the repository and run:

`./gradlew run`

If you have a feature **you can contribute**, a bug you want to fix, or have a bug you'd like to file, please direct it to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/controlsfx/controlsfx/issues).
You can build ControlsFX locally like this:

`./gradlew build check`

If you **want to use** ControlsFX, then you're probably wondering how to use the API that we've slaved over for hours!
In your case, the best and definitive location for help is definitely [our javadocs](https://controlsfx.github.io/javadoc/).
Fear not, these are not a barren wasteland of undescribed functionality - we've poured our hearts into making these javadocs full to the brim of examples, commentary and explanation. If anything is unclear to you, [file a bug in our issue tracker](https://github.com/controlsfx/controlsfx/issues) and we'll do our best to update the documentation straight away!

If you **have questions**, you should join the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/controlsfx-dev).

Another great place to explore is our **sample code**, all located in the controlsfx-samples directory of this source code repository.
We've put a bunch of effort into making these examples something you can learn from.
