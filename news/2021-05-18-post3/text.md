# New Website for JavaFX Technology

A new website called JFX-Central has been published this week. The site targets Java developers and provides a curated list of people, books, 
and libraries of the JavaFX ecosystem. The idea behind the site is to provide a one-stop destination where developers can find instructions,
news, and inspiration for their day to day programming activities.
