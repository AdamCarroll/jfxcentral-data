**London (CNN)** Prince Harry has spoken about mental health in the trailer for an Apple TV+ documentary series with Oprah Winfrey, which aims to destigmatize the topic.

Harry and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex appear in the emotional trailer for "The Me You Can't See," which will be released Friday.
It also features appearances from celebrities including Lady Gaga, Glenn Close and DeMar DeRozan, who candidly and emotionally discuss their experiences of poor mental health.
"To make that decision to receive help is not a sign of weakness. In today's world, more than ever, it is a sign of strength," Harry tells Winfrey, with whom he co-created and executive produced the show.
